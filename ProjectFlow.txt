Here's a README checklist that outlines the remaining tasks for your food delivery application. Since youâ€™ve already set up several components (like database connection, models, and authentication), the list will focus on other essential steps.

Food Delivery Application Development Checklist
1. Authentication & Authorization
    User Authentication (NextAuth.js setup, bcrypt password hashing)
    Restaurant Authentication (NextAuth.js setup, bcrypt password hashing)
    Authorization Logic for Protected Routes
    Implement role-based access control for user and restaurant roles (e.g., restricting access to the restaurant dashboard).
2. Database Models
    User Model
        Schema: username, email, password, firstName, lastName, role
    Restaurant Model
        Schema: username, email, password, restaurantName, phoneNumber, address, city, country, role
    Menu Item Model 
        Schema: name, price, restaurantId (relation to Restaurant), description, category, image, available
    Order Model
        Schema: userId, restaurantId, items (array of MenuItem), totalPrice, status, createdAt
    Delivery Person Model (optional)
        Schema: username, email, password, phoneNumber, vehicleType
3. API Routes
    User Registration API
        Endpoint: /api/users/signup----------done
    Logic: Register users, hash passwords, store in MongoDB.
        Restaurant Registration API-------------done
    Endpoint: /api/restaurants/signup
        Logic: Register restaurants, hash passwords, store in MongoDB.--------done
    User Login API
        Implement using NextAuth.js (already done).--------done
    Restaurant Login API
        Implement using NextAuth.js (already done).----------done
    Menu Item CRUD API
        Endpoints: /api/menu-items (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
        Logic: Create, read, update, and delete menu items for restaurants.-------done
    Order Management API
        Endpoints: /api/orders (GET, POST)
        Logic: Create orders for users, update order status, fetch user orders.
4. Frontend
    User Signup Form
        Create signup form for users, link to the User Signup API.
    Restaurant Signup Form
        Create signup form for restaurants, link to the Restaurant Signup API.
    User/Restaurant Login Form
        Use NextAuth.js signIn() method for logging in users and restaurants.
    Restaurant Dashboard
        Create a protected page for restaurant owners to manage their menu, view orders, and manage restaurant details.
    Menu Page
        Display menu items for each restaurant to users.
    Order Page
        Allow users to create orders, show order details, and track order status.
5. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
    Protect User Pages
        Only allow users to access certain pages (e.g., their orders, profile).
    Protect Restaurant Pages
        Restrict restaurant pages (e.g., dashboard, order management) to only restaurant accounts.
    Admin Dashboard (Optional)
        Set up an admin dashboard for managing users, restaurants, and orders (optional).
6. Testing
    Unit Tests
        Write tests for database models, API routes, and authentication using Jest or Mocha.
    Integration Tests
        Test interaction between components (e.g., a full signup/login process, placing an order) using Cypress or Playwright.
    End-to-End Testing
        Use Cypress to simulate user flows like registering, logging in, creating orders, etc.
7. Deployment
    Configure Environment Variables
        Ensure .env file has variables for MongoDB connection, NextAuth.js secret, and any other third-party services.
    Deploy Backend & Frontend
        Use Vercel for Next.js deployment.
        Host MongoDB on MongoDB Atlas or another cloud provider.
    Set Up CI/CD
        Set up continuous integration/continuous deployment pipeline (e.g., with GitHub Actions).
8. Optional Features
    Payment Integration
        Add payment processing (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) to allow users to pay for orders.
    Delivery Management
        Implement functionality for delivery personnel to view and update the status of their deliveries.
    Real-Time Notifications
        Use Socket.IO or another WebSocket solution for real-time updates on order status.
    Geolocation & Map Integration
        Allow users to track their orders with real-time location updates from delivery personnel.
